After the accident, you thought to yourself, how am I suppose to know the safe distance I should keep in order to not have my headlight shattered. This project's goal is to create an android app that will tackle the problem of finding out the safe distance you should keep from the vehicle (object) in front. With the input of your phone's camera, your car will have the luxury of object detection.",
